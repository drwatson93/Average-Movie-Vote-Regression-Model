This assignment is to learn the “End-to-endMachine Learning Pipeline”. The goal is toselect and traina regression model to predict the “average rating/vote”for each movie based on the other relevant features.  The data istaken from “The Movie Database (TMDb)”(attached) and includes the info for around 5000 movies. 

You need to do the following:

1-Follow all the steps that we did for the housing data during the class (e.g.,data load, handling missing data, pre-processing, feature selection, model selections, cross validation,and hyperparameter selection)

2-Perform exploratory data analysis to understand data

3-Handle missing data (if any) and explain the reason behind your strategy

4-Select therelevant features. Explainthe reasons behind any feature elimination

5-Encode categorical values. Note that there are categorical features with more than one value (e.g., genres). How do you represent them?

6-Create a Scikit-learn pipeline to do all pre-processing steps

7-Split datarandomly. 80% training data and20% test data

8-Use 5-fold cross validation for model selection. Compare KNN Regressionand Linear regression. Use grid search to fine-tune themodels (select hyperparameters)

9-Reportand analyzethe error (RMSE) on test data for the final selected model.
